# fx_database_fetch
Application for managing simple database (adding or removing info). 
Database contains one table with three fields (id, information, number).
The application created using javafx for nice GUI. It connects to MySQL database. 
I chose this db cause it is free and widely distributed. 
I know that code is simple and sometimes weird or even stupid but I'm working on it.
